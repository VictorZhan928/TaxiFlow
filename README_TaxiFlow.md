# TaxiFlow NYC ðŸš–  
**Data-Driven Insights for Better Rides in NYC**

## ðŸ“˜ Overview  
TaxiFlow is a comprehensive analytics dashboard designed to forecast NYC taxi demand and trip durations using real-world data. By integrating weather, event, and trip records, this project provides insights for fleet managers, drivers, transit planners, and rideshare companies to optimize vehicle deployment and improve service.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Predict taxi demand fluctuations and trip durations.
- Quantify impacts of weather conditions and special events.
- Build a scalable data pipeline and intuitive dashboard for stakeholders.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources  
- **NYC Taxi Trip Data (3.5 GB)** â€“ Pickup/dropoff times, fares, tips, passenger counts.  
- **NYC Permitted Events (931 MB)** â€“ Records of concerts, parades, sports events.  
- **NOAA Weather (347 KB)** â€“ Hourly weather conditions for 2023.  
- **NYC Taxi Zone Data (8 KB)** â€“ Borough and neighborhood mappings.

---

## ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning Summary  
- Removed duplicates and invalid rows (e.g., negative fares, passenger counts > 6).
- Standardized event categories using keyword matching.
- Engineered `weather_type` (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy) for readability.
- Linked location IDs to zones and aligned weather/events to trip timestamps.

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack  
- **Python** â€“ Data scraping, cleaning, and batch processing  
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ Central database for trip, zone, weather, and event tables  
- **Streamlit** â€“ Dashboard UI  
- **Spark (planned)** â€“ Scalable ETL for big data ingestion  
- **AWS RDS + S3** â€“ Cloud hosting and storage
